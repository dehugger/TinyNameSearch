# TinyNameSearch
A tiny console application for searching through a dataset of first names.

Requires [NamesDatasetV1](https://github.com/philipperemy/name-dataset)

## V1
Enter an initial set of three characters to see a list of first names.

## V2
V2 Allows you to use a name prefix of any length, with near-instant lookups. It also now sorts alphabetically by column rather then by row, and will fill the entire screen rather then a hard limit of 4 columns. 

The downside is it takes significantly longer to load and has a large memory footprint. This one should probably be named NotSoTinyNameSearch.
